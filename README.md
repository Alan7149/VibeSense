# VibeSense

**VibeSense** is an Android application designed to assist deaf individuals by translating important environmental sounds into unique vibration patterns. The app detects sounds like doorbells, alarms, or someone calling the userâ€™s name, and notifies the user through customized vibrations on their phone. **VibeSense** empowers users to stay aware of critical audio cues in real-time, providing an accessible and intuitive way to "feel" their surroundings.

This app focuses on personalizing sound recognition, offering the ability to customize which sounds trigger the vibrations and the intensity of the vibration patterns. Users can add their own sound profiles for a more tailored experience, ensuring they never miss important alerts, even in noisy environments.
